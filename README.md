# MARS-ROVER

I have tried to solved this problem using Object-Orientated Design with the SOLID principles in mind. 

My approach has been implemented by creating two classes : Plateau and Rover.


## How to run the application

* Add devDependencies by running:
```
npm install
```

* Feed input to the program by running:

```
npm run rover
```

* See tests by running:

```
npm test
```
